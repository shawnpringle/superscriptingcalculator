Installation Instructions.
------------------------------

Product: win32lib
Version: 0.70.1

How To Install:
-----------------
1. Create a folder. This is where the extracted files will be placed.
   If you wish to overwrite your existing Win32lib, you can reuse the
   folder already created for that.

   (example:  mkdir c:\win32ib)

2. Extract all the contents of the distribution ZIP file, keeping the
   folder structure intact. That means that the files in the ZIP file
   need to be extracted in the sub-folders as noted in the ZIP file.

3. Ensure that the EUINC Environment Variable contains a reference to
   the folder that now contains the extracted files.


Post Installation
--------------------
To verify if it all worked, start a DOS command window and enter ...

   c:
   cd \win32lib\demo
   exwc rundemos

This should run the Demonstration Gateway program.

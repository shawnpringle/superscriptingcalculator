<h1>SYNOPSIS of <a href="#INTRODUCTION">Win32Lib</a>
Documentation:</h1>

<h3><strong>BASIC INFO:</strong></h3>

<p><font size="3">Win32Lib is a library of routines which make
programming for Windows easier. To use the Win32Lib library you
type:</font><font size="1"> </font></p>

<pre>include win32lib.ew</pre>

<p><font size="3">on a line all by itself at the beginning of
your program. You can then use the routines defined in the
library in your own Windows program. (Note: there is a separate </font><a
href="#IDE:"><font size="3">IDE</font></a><font size="3"> program
available from user contributions at </font><a
href="http://www.rapideuphoria.com/"><font size="3">RDS</font></a><font
size="3"> to make this process easier.)</font></p>

<h3>CORE CONCEPTS:</h3>

<dir>
    <li><a href="CONTROL.htm#CONTROL">CONTROLS</a> are the basic
        visual &amp; useable elements of Windows programs. They
        are what you see, act upon, or set to perform actions.
        They include the main &amp; other windows, timers, list
        boxes, buttons, status bars, etc. You can <a
        href="ATTRIBUTE.htm#CREATE">create</a> them, query and
        change their <a href="ATTRIBUTE.htm#ATTRIBUTE">Attributes</a>,
        and write code to respond to <a href="EVENT.htm#EVENT">Events</a>
        which happen to
        them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
    <li><a href="ATTRIBUTE.htm#ATTRIBUTE">ATTRIBUTES of Controls</a>:
        Controls can have a variety of properties, such as size
        of the control, font size, font color, etc. Various
        routines let you inspect and alter attributes of
        controls. </li>
    <li><a href="EVENT.htm#EVENT">EVENTS</a>: In addition to
        creating controls and setting their attributes, Windows
        programming consists of writing routines to respond to
        various events, such as actions taken by the user of the
        application - mouse clicks, key presses, resizing
        windows, and so on. These response routines are called
        &quot;Event Handlers&quot;. You must also refer a desired
        event on a specified control to the appropriate event
        handler routine, using the <a href="EVENT.htm#SETHANDLER">setHandler()</a>
        routine. Note: These events must be events which are
        already predefined within Win32Lib itself.</li>
    <li><a href="ATTRIBUTE.htm#WINMAIN">MAIN EVENT LOOP</a> :
        WinMain is the main processing loop for Win32Lib. You
        call WinMain at the VERY END of your program. This must
        be after ALL your controls have been declared, after all
        the routines you have written to handle all of the events
        you want to be responded to in your program, and after
        all the <a href="#EVENTTRIGGER">event handler statements</a>
        which direct the program to the various appropriate event
        handler routines. </li>
</dir>

<hr>

<h3><a name="EVENTTRIGGER">EVENT HANDLER STATEMENTS:</a></h3>

<p>In order to make your program respond to some known event, you
must write an <a href="EVENT.htm#SETHANDLER">event handler
statement</a>, somewhere AFTER the routine you have written to
respond to &amp; handle the occurance of the event, like this: </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setHandler(controlID,
eventType, routine_id(&quot;event_handler_name&quot;))</p>

<p>where controlID is a <a href="CONTROL.htm#CONTROL">control</a>
you have created, eventType is a defined <a
href="EVENT.htm#EVENT">event</a>, routine_id is typed in small
letters, and the event_handler_name is the name of the procedure
you made to handle the occurance of the event. </p>

<p>example: </p>

<p>-- event handling procedure:<br>
procedure onClick_btnToDoSomething()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--do something<br>
end procedure </p>

<p>-- event to respond to:<br>
setHandler(btnToDoSomething, w32HClick, routine_id
(&quot;onClick_btnDoSomething&quot;) </p>

<h3><a name="IDE:">IDE:</a></h3>

<p>There is an Integrated Development Environment program
available from user contributions at <a
href="http://www.rapideuphoria.com/">RDS</a> which utilizes
Win32Lib to give Windows programmers the ability to easily create
the visual elements of a Windows program by mouse clicks, like
Visual Basic. It also allows event handlers to be easily created.</p>

  LIST OF WIN32LIB EXAMPLE PROGRAMS TO RUN UNDER RunDemos
 
  DON'T CHANGE THIS FILE UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING!

 NOTE: As of March xx, 2002, this file can be edited
       from within RunDemos, & doesn't need to be hand edited.

  File Purpose:
  This file is a STRUCTURED list of all the example programs for Win32Lib,
    for use by the examples gateway program, RunDemos;
    it is read by RunDemos to populate lists in tab folders which
    provide the user with the opportunity to run or view those examples.
 
  IF YOU MESS THIS FILE'S STRUCTURE UP, RunDemos WON'T RUN RIGHT!
 
  File Structure:
  LINES IN THIS FILE STARTING WITH A SPACE ARE IGNORED, AS ARE BLANK LINES;
  lines starting with -- are the names FOR THE TABS in the tab folders;
  in any other line, text before 1st = is an EXAMPLE FILE NAME minus extent;
  text after first = is the DESCRIPTION for that example.
 
  Adding new examples or folders:
      DON'T start a line for an additional example or folder with a space,
      and DO place EACH ADDITION on a SEPARATE line.
   To add a NEW EXAMPLE,
    add it somewhere with all the existing examples for that tab name,
    with the example file name minus its extent first, followed by a colon,
    then followed by a description of the example, no longer than a line.
   To add a NEW TAB FOLDER NAME,
    enter two dashes at the beginning of a line,
    followed by the desired tab folder name;
    the actual tab folder name will be what you place there,
     plus the word, "examples".
   To DELETE an example, just delete it from this file
